## Exercise 1

Let $$f: I \to \mathbb{R}^n$$ a [differentiable curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_curve). If exists $$a \in I$$ and $$b \in \mathbb{R}^n$$ such that $$a$$ is an accumulation point of $$f^{-1}(b)$$, show that $$f'(a) = 0$$.

By the fact that $$a$$ is an accumulation point of $$f^{-1}(b)$$, we have that for every sequence of points $$(a_n)$$ such that $$\lim{a_n} = a$$ is true that $$a_n \in f^{-1}(b)$$ for all $$n$$. It follows from the continuity of $$f$$ that:

$$
\lim{a_n} = a \implies f(a) = \lim{f(a_n)} = \lim{b} = b.
$$

We know that $$f$$ is differentiable, then exists $$f'(a)$$. We only need to consider a single sequence to figure out its value. Let $$h_n = a_n - a$$, clearyly $$h \to 0$$ when $$n \to \infty$$. Then:

$$
f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0}{\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}} = \lim \frac{f(a+h_n) - f(a)}{h_n} = \lim \frac{f(a_n) - f(a)}{h_n} = \lim \frac{0}{h_n} = 0.
$$

## Exercise 3

Let $$f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^3$$ the cylindrical helix, defined by $$f(t) = (\cos{t}, \sin{t}, t)$$. Show that, for all $$t \in \mathbb{R}$$, the line that goes through the points $$f(t)$$ and $$f(t)+f''(t)$$ intersects the vertical axis of $$\mathbb{R}^3$$.

From the definition of $$f$$ we have that $$f'(t) = (-\sin{t}, \cos{t}, 1)$$ and $$f''(t) = (-\cos{t}, -\sin{t}, 0)$$, hence $$f(f) + f''(t) = (0, 0, t)$$. Clearly any line that contains $$f(t)+f''(t)$$ intersects the vertical axis because it belongs to it.
